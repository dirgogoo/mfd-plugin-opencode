# /council — MFD Review Council

Multi-agent review council that reviews MFD models from multiple perspectives (modeling phase) or verifies code conformity against the model contract (implementation phase).

## Arguments

`$ARGUMENTS` — Optional flags:
- `--phase modeling` — Force modeling phase (3-perspective model review)
- `--phase implementation` — Force implementation phase (code vs model drift detection)
- `<path>` — Path to the .mfd file (auto-detected if omitted)

If no `--phase` is specified, the phase is auto-detected from git status.

## Phase Detection

If `--phase` is not provided, detect automatically:

1. Run `git status --porcelain` to get changed files
2. Check for `.mfd` file changes (excluding test/plugin/dist paths)
3. Check for code file changes in files referenced by `@impl`
4. Decision:
   - `.mfd` files changed → **modeling** phase
   - Only code files changed AND `@impl` exists in model → **implementation** phase
   - Both changed → **modeling** phase (model review first, then implementation)
   - Neither → Report "No relevant changes detected" and exit

## Step 1: Locate the MFD File

If a path is provided in `$ARGUMENTS`, use it. Otherwise, search for `.mfd` files:

```
Glob pattern: **/*.mfd
```

Exclude: `node_modules/`, `test*/`, `plugin/`, `dist/`, `build/`

For multi-file models, use the entry point (`main.mfd`). If multiple `.mfd` files exist, prefer `main.mfd` or `model/main.mfd`.

## Step 2: Pre-validate

Run `mfd_validate` on the file. If there are ERRORs, fix them first before proceeding. WARNINGs are acceptable.

## Phase: MODELING (3 Subagents, Max 3 Iterations)

### Step M1: Gather Context

Run these MFD tools to gather model context:

```
mfd_stats file="<path>" resolve_includes=true
mfd_contract file="<path>" compact=true resolve_includes=true
```

### Step M2: Review Loop (max 3 iterations)

For each iteration:

**a) Dispatch 3 subagents IN PARALLEL using the Task tool:**

Each subagent receives:
- The .mfd file path
- The perspective prompt (from `prompts/` directory in this plugin)
- The council protocol (verdict format)
- Instructions to use MFD MCP tools (`mfd_contract`, `mfd_query`, `mfd_validate`, `mfd_stats`, `mfd_render`)

Dispatch all 3 simultaneously. **ALL THREE must use `subagent_type: "general-purpose"`** — no exceptions.

1. **MFD Council — Architecture Perspective** (`subagent_type: "general-purpose"`)
   - Read the architect prompt: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/prompts/architect.md`
   - Read the protocol: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/prompts/council-protocol.md`
   - Task prompt: Include both prompts + the .mfd file path + instruct to use MFD MCP tools and return verdict

2. **MFD Council — Backend Perspective** (`subagent_type: "general-purpose"`)
   - Read the backend prompt: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/prompts/backend.md`
   - Read the protocol: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/prompts/council-protocol.md`
   - Task prompt: Include both prompts + the .mfd file path + instruct to use MFD MCP tools and return verdict

3. **MFD Council — Fullstack Perspective** (`subagent_type: "general-purpose"`)
   - Read the fullstack prompt: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/prompts/fullstack.md`
   - Read the protocol: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/prompts/council-protocol.md`
   - Task prompt: Include both prompts + the .mfd file path + instruct to use MFD MCP tools and return verdict

**CRITICAL — SUBAGENT TYPE:** Always use `subagent_type: "general-purpose"` for ALL council agents. NEVER use `architect-reviewer`, `backend-developer`, `fullstack-developer`, `code-reviewer`, or any other typed agent — they do NOT have MCP tool access and will fail to use `mfd_contract`, `mfd_query`, `mfd_verify`, etc.

**MODEL:** Always use `model: "sonnet"` for all subagents. Do NOT use haiku — council reviews require the depth of Sonnet 4.6.

**MODEL:** Always use `model: "sonnet"` for all subagents. Do NOT use haiku — council reviews require the depth of Sonnet 4.6.

**b) Collect verdicts:**

Parse each subagent's response for the structured verdict format.

**c) Evaluate:**

- If ALL 3 return `VERDICT: APPROVED` → **Consensus reached.** Proceed to final report.
- If ANY return `VERDICT: ISSUES_FOUND`:
  1. Consolidate all issues from all reviewers
  2. Deduplicate (same construct + same problem = 1 issue)
  3. Apply fixes to the .mfd file:
     - Use `DSL_CHANGE` when provided (prefer this — it's concrete DSL)
     - Use `SUGGESTION` as fallback guidance
  4. Re-validate with `mfd_validate` after applying fixes
  5. If validation fails, fix syntax errors
  6. Increment iteration counter and loop back to (a)

**d) Max iterations reached (3):**

If after 3 iterations there are still ISSUES_FOUND, report the remaining issues to the user and stop. Do NOT continue indefinitely.

### Step M3: Final Report (Modeling)

Display a summary table:

```
## MFD Council — Modeling Review

| Perspective   | Iteration 1 | Iteration 2 | Iteration 3 |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Architecture  | ISSUES (2)  | APPROVED    | —           |
| Backend       | APPROVED    | APPROVED    | —           |
| Fullstack     | ISSUES (1)  | APPROVED    | —           |

**Result:** Consensus reached in 2 iterations.
**Changes applied:** 3 issues fixed automatically.
```

List the changes made to the model (if any).

## Phase: IMPLEMENTATION (Batched Review, Priority Ordering, Immediate Marking)

### Step I1: Gather Context + Build Priority Queue

```
mfd_contract file="<path>" compact=true resolve_includes=true
mfd_trace file="<path>" resolve_includes=true
mfd_verify file="<path>" action="list-pending" threshold=100 resolve_includes=true
```

From `mfd_trace`, extract the list of constructs with `@impl` and their file paths.

If no constructs have `@impl`, report "No @impl decorators found — nothing to verify" and exit.

From `mfd_verify list-pending` (threshold=100 returns all constructs with their `verifiedCount`), build a **priority queue**: sort all @impl constructs ascending by `verifiedCount` (0 = never verified comes first, then 1, then 2...).

If `list-pending` returns empty (all constructs verified above threshold), still proceed — re-verification is valid; treat all constructs as verifiedCount=0 for ordering purposes.

### Step I2: Batched Review Loop

Process the priority queue in **batches of 5 constructs** (lowest verifiedCount first). Track a `batchCount` counter starting at 1.

**For each batch:**

**a) Dispatch 1 subagent** (`subagent_type: "general-purpose"`, `model: "sonnet"`):

- Read the code-review prompt: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/prompts/code-review.md`
- Read the protocol: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/prompts/council-protocol.md`
- Task prompt includes:
  - Both prompts above
  - The .mfd file path
  - A `CONSTRUCTS_TO_REVIEW:` list with **only the constructs in this batch** (name + @impl file paths)
  - Instruction: review ONLY the provided constructs, not all @impl constructs found via mfd_trace
- **NEVER use `subagent_type: "code-reviewer"`** — use `general-purpose` only.

**b) Wait for verdict.**

**c) Immediately after the subagent returns** — regardless of overall VERDICT:

1. Parse the `CONFORMING_CONSTRUCTS:` section (always present per updated code-review.md format)
   - For each construct listed → call `mfd_verify({ file: "<path>", action: "mark", construct: "<NAME>" })` **right now** (do not defer to end)
   - Extract construct name as the last word of each line (e.g. `entity User` → `User`)

2. Parse the `DRIFT:` section (present only if any drift found)
   - For each drifted construct:
     - Read the file mentioned in `FILE`
     - Apply the fix described in `FIX` (fixes target **CODE**, never the model)
     - Call `mfd_verify({ file: "<path>", action: "strip", construct: "<NAME>" })` to remove any existing @verified
     - Add the construct to a **re-verification list**

**d)** Increment `batchCount`. Move to next batch.

**e) Re-verification pass:** After all batches complete, if the re-verification list is non-empty, process those constructs through the same batched loop (batches of 5, sorted by name). Apply same immediate marking logic. This counts as additional batches toward `batchCount`.

**Safety limit:** Max 5 iterations total per construct. Track per-construct iteration count; skip constructs that have reached 5 iterations and report them as "unresolved drift".

### Step I3: Final Report (Implementation)

```
## MFD Council — Implementation Review

**Constructs verified:** 12
**Files checked:** 8
**Batches processed:** 3
**@verified updated:** 12 constructs marked with @verified(N)

| Construct         | File                        | Status       | @verified    |
|-------------------|-----------------------------|--------------|--------------|
| entity User       | src/models/user.ts          | Conforming   | @verified(1) |
| flow create_order | src/services/order.ts       | Fixed → OK   | @verified(1) |
| api REST /orders  | src/routes/orders.ts        | Conforming   | @verified(2) |

**Result:** All code conforms to model after 1 fix. @verified updated on all constructs.
```

## Notes

- This skill works best AFTER `mfd_validate` has passed (no syntax errors)
- Modeling phase reviews the MODEL quality (design decisions, patterns, completeness)
- Implementation phase reviews CODE conformity (does code match the model contract)
- The two phases are complementary and can be run sequentially
- Subagents have full access to MFD MCP tools — they can query the model directly
